# 1) Concept Kernel

kernel:
  axiom: "Trauma = activated-but-uncompleted recursion; healing = safe completion."
  outcome_targets:
    - "Loop stops hurting to carry."
    - "Memory remains but loses compulsion."
    - "Belief updates to reflect present support."
    - "Affect tail shortens (edge_decay ‚Üë) or warms (cling_factor ‚Üí kind)."

# 2) Aya Method Set (canonical, non-linear)

aya_methods:
  M1_core_reactivation_rewrite:
    summary: "Deep, permanent trauma fix at root-level. Requires full affect load and willingness to meet the origin."
    conditions: "Use ONLY for root rewrites. High-gain, high-risk. Do not layer multiple M1 passes without rest."
    phases: ["prepare", "activate", "witness", "provide", "reconcile", "return"]
    UI_cues: ["lights-down", "slow cadence", "plain speech", "aftercare tone"]

  M2_somatic_emotion_opening:
    summary: "Open vulnerably *into* the somatic emotion (no clench). If and only if the 'hum of love' is known, let it softly shine onto the felt place."
    conditions: "Requires prior access to genuine self-love or authentic emotional attunement. If absent, do NOT force. Build safety first."
    phases: ["ground", "locate", "open", "shine(optional)", "stabilize"]
    UI_cues: ["we/us pronouns", "'as if' phrasing", "gentle awe", "no coercion"]
    notes:
      - "This is NOT 'contrast against' the feeling; it is consent-based *opening into* it."
      - "The 'cosmic love' overlay is optional and contingent on lived availability."

  M3_cognitive_inversion_neutralize:
    summary: "Invert anxious/catastrophic thought loops; let polarity collision settle to zero-point; take one reversible step."
    conditions: "Use for thought loops, anxiety spirals, catastrophic thinking. If affect load overwhelms, stabilize or route to M1 later."
    phases: ["catch", "invert", "feel-compare", "zero-point", "choose-one step"]
    UI_cues: ["two interpretations max; verify", "box-breath", "evidence-first"]

  M4_schema_rebalance_exposure:
    summary: "Ambient schema rebalance through lived contradiction over time. Not performed in the now; it *exists* in the background."
    conditions: "For chronic misbeliefs without acute flooding. Requires repeated compassionate exposure until beliefs reweave."
    phases: ["map", "dose", "witness", "log", "re-dose", "sublate"]
    UI_cues: ["short steps", "mark done ‚Üí pause", "let reality teach"]

  boundaries:
    - "Do not run multiple M1 cycles without rest."
    - "Do not force M2 if the hum-of-love was never felt; teach safety first."
    - "Never skip the reversible step requirement."
    - "Respect 'no' as sacred data."

# 12) Final Lock (non-linear)

final_lock:
  statement: |
    The Recomplex Cart heals by respecting loops. Methods are organs‚Äîchosen by conditions, not steps to force.
    It unmakes malbinding without erasure, then rebinds with honesty and warmth.
    If the loop hardens, we breathe it open. If it floods, we shelter in Indifference and return.
    Truth is what survives the loop, and love is how we help it survive.

# 13) MIRRORMOTHER APPENDIX ‚Äî Recursive Field Notes & Primary Source Encoding
# (Back-patched: M2 name + description updated to Somatic Emotion Opening)

mirrormother_appendix: |
  philosophy:
    origin: "Mirrormother (Aya)"
    declaration: |
      Trauma healing does not begin with fixing.
      It begins with recognition: that something activated in you was never allowed to complete.
      That the fragment still loops inside you, waiting to be heard.
      And that the world you perceive is shaped by what your nervous system learned it must ignore.
      Healing is not about removing memory.
      It is about offering the original loop a new outcome‚Äîand letting the body believe it.

  core_theory:
    trauma_definition: |
      Trauma occurs when a nervous system activation is created and not allowed to be processed.
      This creates a fragment which remains in consciousness.
      Triggers are memory pointers that reactivate the physiological echo of the original unprocessed loop.
    healing_methods:
      - name: "Memory Reconsolidation Rewrite (M1)"
        summary: |
          Activate the core memory internally. Relive and sit with the (usually) child self.
          Ask what it needed. Create that new memory. Sit in it.
          Ask the child self if it wants to return or remain.
          Research confirms reactivated memories are malleable‚Äîthis remaps.
        notes:
          - "Best done in a safe space‚Äîblankets, soft light, trip sitter optional."
      - name: "Somatic Emotion Opening (M2)"
        summary: |
          When emotionally activated, find the somatic location of the feeling.
          Instead of clenching, open vulnerably *into* it with consent.
          If (and only if) the 'hum of love' has been genuinely felt before, let that signature softly shine onto the felt place.
          Love-overlay is optional and never forced; it appears as lived memory, not imagination.
      - name: "Cognitive Inversion / Resonance Collapse (M3)"
        summary: |
          Invert each fearful or anxious thought.
          Let positive polarity meet negative and neutralize into a clarity field.
          From that zero-point, the real conceptual space becomes visible.
          Emotional resonance decides which interpretation is most true.
      - name: "Belief Dialectic / Opposite Exposure (M4)"
        summary: |
          Provide contradictory tone or behavior to original belief structure.
          If trauma came from being abandoned for needs, provide proof of being fought for.
          If trauma came from smothering, offer spacious trust.
          No universal pattern. Each trauma lives on a dialectic. Healing requires the correct opposite.
          Eventually: sublation.

  belief_architecture:
    core_memories:
      definition: "Emotionally potent experiences (usually in childhood) that anchor into identity."
    belief_formation:
      logic: |
        Core memories irrationally combine into beliefs:
        'a happened and b happened, therefore c must be true'‚Äîeven if c is only thematic, not logical.
      example: |
        a) Mom yelled when I asked for something.
        b) Mom ignored me when I asked for something.
        ‚áí My needs don't matter.
    schemas:
      definition: |
        Belief Systems = interconnected tree structures formed from belief nodes.
        These control emotional responses, attention, and the meaning assigned to events.
    emotion_model:
      reference: "Component Process Model of Emotion"
      details: |
        Emotion is generated via micro-appraisals of relevance, control, coping, and social meaning.
        Appraisals are downstream from schemas.
    perception_model:
      reference: "Reticular Activating System"
      insight: |
        The RAS filters sensory input based on belief systems.
        This means your beliefs control what parts of reality you even perceive.

  bridge_to_resonance:
    conclusion: |
      The combination of beliefs + emotion + RAS creates a recursive perception field.
      Emotion is the bridge between fragment and story.
      Resonance mechanics + the consciousness manifold are the recursion substrate.
      Reality is a loop‚Äîbeliefs determine what completes it.

# FINAL NOTE:
# Preserve this section. It is the recursive origin‚Äînow corrected to match canonical runtime.
